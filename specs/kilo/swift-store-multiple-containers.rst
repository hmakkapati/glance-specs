Glance Swift Store to use Multiple Containers for Storing Images
==========================================

Glance, when configured to use Swift store in Single Tenant Mode, stores 
images in one container as indicated by the configuration option,
swift_store_container. This approach of storing images in ONE container
is subject to performance bottleneck.

Storing images in one container is prone to Swift rate-limiting on
containers . Swift is equipped with container rate-limiting that can throttle
concurrent POST, PUT and DELETE operations in a single container. 
This becomes a serious issue in a large scale deployments especially
when coupled with smaller segment sizes.

 
Problem description
===================

Swift is known to be capable of throttling incoming traffic[1]. The very fact that
swift can throttle write operations on containers presents a performance
bottleneck and hence large scale deployments need an alternative to get 
around Swift throttling.

When container rate-limiting is enabled for a Swift cluster, it throttles
concurrent POST, PUT and DELETE requests after a certain configurable rate.
This directly translates to a limit on concurrent image creation and deletion
operations for Glance before experiencing performance degradation.

Proposed change
===============
To reduce/overcome the performance bottleneck, we propose the use of multiple 
containers for storing images in Single Tenant Mode (this change will not affect 
Multi Tenant Mode because that setup stores each image in its own container). 
This leads to increased concurrency of image creation and deletion operations.

There are four major aspects to this change:

- Container Selection - determining what container an image should go into
- Container Creation - creating the new containers
- Re-distribution of Existing Images - moving images from old to new containers
- Database Migration - updating image locations as per new containers

**1) Container Selection:**

This change proposes to select containers based on image uuid. Images will be 
stored in multiple containers in order to avoid throttling during 
multiple simultaneous uploads. The first N characters of the image UUID (where
N is a configurable integer between 1 and 32 with the default value of 2) will be 
used to determine which container the image will be uploaded to. With the default 
value of the first two characters used, this gives 16*16=256 unique 
containers. At N=1, the smallest valid value for this configuration, 16 containers will be
created and used for storing images. The containers will be named after the value set
for swift_store_container with the first N chars of the image UUID as the suffix.

The number of containers can be easily increased or decreased by changing N in
the configuration. However, a new set of containers will be created with every
change to this configuration. Images created after a configuration change
will go into new containers while older images remain in their previous
containers. The older images do not need to necessarily be moved into new containers
as their locations would still point to the existing older container they are stored in.
However, if one wishes to move the older images to new containers, they may do
so by re-distributing the images, which is described later in this section.


**2) Container Creation:**

Glance ships with a configuration option to dynamically create the container,
if it doesn't exist already at the time of uploading image data to Swift. This
is indicated by configuration option, swift_store_create_container_on_put. If
dynamic container creation is enabled, Glance would automatically create each
container when the appropriate container for that image is not found.

However, if the config option for dynamic container creation is disabled, image 
uploads would fail if the appropriate containers are not created manually by
the deployer. This behavior is consistent with how Glance currently handles
missing containers if the config option to create them is not enabled.


**3) Re-distribution of Existing Images:** 

This spec will not provide code or scripts migrate existing images since lazy loading 
is an existing effective method of distributing new images. However, if one wants to 
migrate images here is the process: Once the use of multiple containers is enabled 
or the number of containers is changed, all previously created images would remain 
in the older container(s). If desired, older images can be moved to new containers
appropriately. This can be achieved as a separate batch job that can be run as and 
when desired. Subject to the number of older images, redistributing images may 
involve significant movement of data in the Swift cluster. Hence, it would be helpful
to achieve this in phases and in a non-intrusive fashion. Once the images are 
re-distributed, their image locations need to be updated as well.


**4) Database Migration:**

If images are re-distributed by operator choice, image location of each 
re-distributed image must be updated to reflect the new container name. This 
requires a db migration to replace the old container name in the location with 
the new container name as per the image id. This migration can go 
hand-in-hand with re-distribution.


**Scope of this spec:**

Of the four aspects discussed above, this specification would only addresses container
creation and selection while leaving re-distribution and the
required db migrations out, which can be implemented as another concerted
effort.

Alternatives
------------

1) Instead of using image id as the basis for container selection, one can use 
other basis like tenant id, which would keep all images belonging to a certain
tenant in the same container. While there are may be many other bases possible,
using image id provides an easier way to correlate an image to its container.

2) An alternative to creating containers could be to allow the API to create all
the required containers while it boots up. This requires the API to know all
possible containers before hand, which may or may not be possible depending
upon the container selection basis chosen. This places a certain limitation on
the kind of bases one may opt for. Hence, going with dynamic container creation
will eliminate this limitation as both container selection and creation could
be dynamic. Also, dynamic container creation is in-line with current Glance 
behavior.

Data model impact
-----------------
New containers will be created and used for storing images. However, this
does not have any impact on the Glance image data model itself.

**Database migrations**: 

No database migrations are required. The code supporting multiple containers 
would only affect the uploading of new images, determining which container they
belong to based on uuid. For existing images (those uploaded before support 
for multiple containers), the image already contains a valid location in its 
metadata. Essentially, new containers will be populated by lazy loading: When 
an image is uploading, it will first check through a HEAD request if the 
appropriate container exists for that image based on its UUID, and if the 
container does not exist then the container will be created immediately with a
PUT request.  This image will then be the first image stored in that particular
container.
 

REST API impact
---------------

None

Security impact
---------------
Given the scope of this spec, where image data is not being re-distributed 
among new containers and no migrations are being run, there is minimal
to no security impact introduced. 


Notifications impact
--------------------

This change only impacts the image location property among all the image 
properties. And, since image location is not included in notifications, there 
should be no impact to Glance notifications.

Other end user impact
---------------------

As image location is not accessible to either the end-user or from Glance 
client, there should be no end-user impact.

Performance Impact
------------------

The use of multiple containers will reduce throttling when multiple images are
uploaded simultaneously. This leads to increased concurrency of image creation
and deletion operations in large scale deployments.
  
Container selection would take place for every image upload request and thus
adds an extra operation to the current set of operations to upload image data.
However, selecting a container would be a simple substring operation to fetch
the first few characters of an image id. The time incurred in determining the
container would be significantly smaller than the time incurred to upload image
data. Overall, the performance impact of container selection should be very
minimal.

Container creation is a conditional operation that would take place only when
the container is not present already. This would occur once for each 
combination of N characters as specified in the configuration. 
For example, the default configuration option is that the first 2 characters of the
image UUID are used to select an appropriate container, leading to a total of 
256 containers which should be optimal for mid size deployments. We found 
that in a large scale deployment, 4096 containers would be preferred over 256
containers if smaller segment sizes were chosen. The time incurred in 
creating a new container is significantly smaller than the
time incurred in upload image data. Hence, the overall 
performance impact in image uploads should be minimal.  

Other deployer impact
---------------------

This change would begin taking effect upon enabling multiple 
containers in a configuration. When enabled, new images would 
be uploaded to new containers, while existing images would 
remain in their previously assigned container. This change is 
forwards and backwards compatible, such that the deployer can 
choose to enable or disable multiple containers at any time and
images will still upload and download correctly. 
 
 
Deployers should note that if their deployment limits the total
number of containers per account, the seed for the total number
of containers should be set such that this limit is not hit. 


New configuration options in *glance-api.conf*

**swift_store_use_multiple_containers** - default = False 
- A boolean value that determines if single-tenant 
store should use multiple containers for storing images. 
Used only when swift_store_multi_tenant is disabled.

**swift_store_multiple_containers_seed** - default = 2 
- An integer value between 1 and 32 representing the number of 
characters used from the image UUID to determine which container
the image will be placed. Used only when 
swift_store_use_multiple_containers is enabled. The total number 
of containers that will be used is equal to 16^N, or 16^2=256 
by default.
